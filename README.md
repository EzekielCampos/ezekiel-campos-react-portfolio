## Description

This project is a professional portfolio that showcases my projects and experiences as a developer and a professional to the user.  Using the React library, I was able to create a single page application that has a dynamic and intuitive interface.  React is incredibly powerful and versatile by allowing Javascript functions to be incorporated inside the HTML like syntax.  In addition it makes styling much easier and components reusable throughout a project.  Material UI was the main library I used that assisted in the interface and design of the page.  This coupled with React worked beautifully together in creating clean forms, footers and navigation bar.  React Final Form was a great library to have in the form in that it dealt with all the state changes from the input and made submittal simple.  In addition, Vite server was used during development to render the application in real time which efficiently compiled code depending on what part I was working on.  There was definitely a learning curve with understanding how to build components and managing states.  After going through this whole building process though I understand the appeal of using React because of how versatile and flexible it can be while creating components.

## Installation

In order to install this project ensure that Node is installed.  Either fork this repo or download all the files inside this repository.  To install all the packages run the command “npm i”.  Once all the packages are installed you can test the application by running the command “npm run dev” which will redirect you to local host and display the home page.  

## Usage

In order to run the server enter the command “npm run dev”.  If you are successful it will redirect to the local host and whatever port that was specified.  If you are about to deploy the page ensure that you bundle the code by running the command “npm run build” which ensures your code is optimized and bundled efficiently when you’re ready to deploy

## Tests

I wrote a few test for the List and Card components that are frequently being resued.  To run these test type the command "npm run test" which will use the Vite test that is very similar to jest to run the test.jsx files that are in this repo.  Feel free to write any ones that you feel are beneficial!
